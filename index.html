      <p>Soccer has been around for hundreds of years. In England, soccer has been highly known, dating back to the early 12th century. Soccer is a sport in which two teams play against one another and eleven players on each team. The positions are right and left fullback, the goalkeeper, the right Midfielder/Winger, central/Box-to-Box Midfielder, center back, and defending/Holding Midfielder.
